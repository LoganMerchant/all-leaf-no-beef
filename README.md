# All Leaf, No Beef

## Introduction

All Leaf, No Beef is a gardening site for people entering into the world of home-grown produce. It offers a forum for both experts and newcomers to discuss tips and tricks they've learned about. In addition to that, users who sign up are able to track the sunlight and amount of water needed for a variety of plants they may currently be growing. Not only does the site offer a 7 day tracker for this, but users will also be sent text message reminders of which produce needs their attention that day.
