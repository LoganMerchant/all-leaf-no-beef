## Description

The site offers a forum for both experts and newcomers to discuss tips and tricks they've learned about. In addition to that, users who sign up are able to track the sunlight and amount of water needed for a variety of plants they may currently be growing. Not only does the site offer a 7 day tracker for this, but users will also be sent text message reminders of which produce needs their attention that day.

## Usage

While anyone who navigates to the site will be able to view any current posts and their comments, they'll need to navigate to the signup page to take full advantage of the site.

**Currently there is no way to delete tracked produce or unenroll in SMS messaging. A fix will be deployed soon, but please be aware of this.**
